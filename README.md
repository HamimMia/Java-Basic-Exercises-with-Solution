 These exercises help you to improve your Java programming coding skills. Currently, following sections are available, we are working hard to add more exercises .... Happy Coding!
 <br>
 Exercise1:
 <br>Write a Java program to print 'Hello' on screen and then print your name on a separate line.<br>
 
 Exercise2: 
 <br>Write a Java program to print the sum of two numbers. Go to the editor,
 <br>Test Data: 74 + 36.<br>
 
 Exercise3: 
 <br>Write a Java program to divide two numbers and print on the screen. Go to the editor, 
 <br>Test Data: 50/3.<br>
 
 Exercise4: 
 <br>Write a Java program to print the result of the following operations.
 <br>Test Data:
 <br>a. -5 + 8 * 6
 <br>b. (55+9) % 9
 <br>c. 20 + -3*5 / 8
 <br>d. 5 + 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3<br>
 
 Exercise5: 
 <br>Write a Java program that takes two numbers as input and display the product of two numbers.
 <br>Test Data:
 <br>Input first number: 25
 <br>Input second number: 5<br>
 
 Exercise6: 
 <br>Write a Java program to print the sum (addition), multiply, subtract, divide and remainder of two numbers.
 <br>Test Data:
 <br>Input first number: 125
 <br>Input second number: 24
 <br>Expected Output :
 <br>125 + 24 = 149
 <br>125 - 24 = 101
 <br>125 x 24 = 3000
 <br>125 / 24 = 5
 <br>125 mod 24 = 5<br>
 
 Exercise7: 
 <br>Write a Java program that takes a number as input and prints its multiplication table upto 10. Go to the editor
 <br>Test Data:
 <br>Input a number: 8
 <br>Expected Output :
 <br>8 x 1 = 8
 <br>8 x 2 = 16
 <br>8 x 3 = 24
 <br>...
 <br>8 x 10 = 80<br>
 
 Exercise8:
 <br>Write a Java program to compute the specified expressions and print the output.
 <br>Test Data:
 <br>((25.5 * 3.5 - 3.5 * 3.5) / (40.5 - 4.5))
 <br>Expected Output
 <br>2.138888888888889<br>
 
 Exercise9: 
 <br>Write a Java program to compute a specified formula.
 <br>Specified Formula :
 <br>4.0 * (1 - (1.0/3) + (1.0/5) - (1.0/7) + (1.0/9) - (1.0/11))
 <br>Expected Output
 <br>2.9760461760461765<br>
 
 Exercise10: 
 <br>Write a Java program to print the area and perimeter of a circle.
 <br>Test Data:
 <br>Radius = 7.5
 <br>Expected Output
 <br>Perimeter is = 47.12388980384689
 <br>Area is = 176.71458676442586<br>
 
 Exercise11: 
 <br>Write a Java program that takes three numbers as input to calculate and print the average of the numbers.
 
 Exercise12: 
 <br>Write a Java program to print the area and perimeter of a rectangle. Go to the editor
 <br>Test Data:
 <br>Width = 5.5 Height = 8.5
 <br>Expected Output
 <br>Area is 5.6 * 8.5 = 47.60
 <br>Perimeter is 2 * (5.6 + 8.5) = 28.20<br>
