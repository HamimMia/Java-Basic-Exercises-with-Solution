 Test Data: 50/3.<br>
 
 Exercise4: 
 Write a Java program to print the result of the following operations.
 Test Data:
 a. -5 + 8 * 6
 b. (55+9) % 9
 c. 20 + -3*5 / 8
 d. 5 + 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3<br>
 
 Exercise5: 
 Write a Java program that takes two numbers as input and display the product of two numbers.
 Test Data:
 Input first number: 25
 Input second number: 5<br>
 
 Exercise6: 
 Write a Java program to print the sum (addition), multiply, subtract, divide and remainder of two numbers.
 Test Data:
 Input first number: 125
 Input second number: 24
 Expected Output :
 125 + 24 = 149
 125 - 24 = 101
 125 x 24 = 3000
 125 / 24 = 5
 125 mod 24 = 5<br>
 
 Exercise7:

 Test Data:
 Input a number: 8
 Expected Output :
 8 x 1 = 8
 8 x 2 = 16
 8 x 3 = 24
 ...
 8 x 10 = 80<br>
 
 Exercise8:
